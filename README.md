## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am generally interested in programming languages and their mathematical expressiveness.  Professionally, this has driven me towards MLOps and improving user experience of systems for contributing scientists.

I am a dad, husband, and native Texan.  I would love to hear what you are working on, so <a href="mailto:jordanrule@gmail.com">drop a line</a>!
